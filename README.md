# Priority Task Tracker
 
The Priority Task Tracker is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently by prioritizing them based on importance and urgency.  The tool provides three levels of priority, allowing users to categorize tasks according to their significance.  Tasks are further sorted by deadlines, ensuring that the most pressing assignments are always at the top of the list.  

To enhance usability, the interface uses color coding and font boldness to draw attention to tasks as their deadlines approach.  Tasks due within a week have their due dates displayed in red, while those due today are bolded for emphasis.  Overdue tasks are highlighted in dark red and bolded to stress their urgency.  Tasks with deadlines more than a week away are displayed in a faint gray, indicating that they are less critical at the moment. 

The website allows for users to add, edit, and delete tasks easily.  New tasks can be created on the Add Task page, where users can specify the task title, due date, priority, and an optional description.  An existing task can be modified or deleted on the Edit Task page, which also allows users to mark it as completed.  Additionally, users can view their completed tasks for reference or to reactivate them if needed.
